If you know nothing about web development the best thing would be to
<ol>
<li>Get a beginner level knowledge through online platforms.</li>
<li>Instead of learning more, start off with some small projects and try to successfully implement what all you have learnt.</li>

  <ul><h1 >SOME HANDY TECHS</h1>
  </br>
    <li>When it comes to rendering CSS styles, browsers like Firefox and Internet Explorer have different ways of handling them. reset.css resets all fundamental styles, so you starts with a real blank new stylesheets.</li>
  </br>  <li>Advantages of Class over ID
These two selectors often confuse beginners. In CSS, class is represented by a dot "." while id is a hash ‘#". In a nutshell id is used on style that is unique and don’t repeat itself, class on the other side, can be re-use</li>
</br><li>Forget table, try div
One of the greatest advantage of CSS is the use of div to achieve total flexibility in terms of styling. div are unlike table, where contents are ‘locked’ within a td‘s cell. It’s safe to say most table layouts are achievable with the use of div and proper styling, well maybe except massive tabular contents.</li>
</li>
</br><li>Knowing !important
Any style marked with !important will be taken into use regardlessly if there’s a overwriting rule below it.


 { background-color:blue !important; background-color:red;}
In the example above, background-color:blue will be adapted because it’s marked with !important, even when there’s a background-color:red; below it. !important is used in situation where you want to force a style without something overwriting it, however it may not work in Internet Explorer.</li></ul>
