<font size='10'><center><u>FORM</u></center></font>
HTML <font color='red'>Forms</font> are required, when you want to collect some data from the site visitor.<br> 
For <b>example</b>, during user registration you would like to collect information such as name, email address, credit card, etc.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>A webform, web form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing.
<li> Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. 
<li>For example, forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product, or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.

<li> The form is enclosed in an HTML table for visual layout.
<li>Forms are enclosed in the HTML form tag. This tag specifies the communication endpoint the data entered into the form should be submitted to,
<br> and the method of submitting the data, GET or POST.

</ul>
<ol>
<li><b>text</b> — a simple text box that allows input of a single line of text.
<li><b>email</b> - a type of text that requires a partially validated email address
<li><b>number</b> - a type of text that requires a number
<li><b>password</b> — similar to text, it is used for security purposes, in which the characters typed in are invisible or replaced by symbols such as *)
<li><b>radio</b> — a radio button
<li><b>file</b> — a file select control for uploading a file
<li><b>reset</b> — a reset button that, when activated, tells the browser to restore the values to their initial values.
<li><b>submit</b> — a button that tells the browser to take action on the form (typically to send it to a server)
<li><b>textarea</b> — much like the text input field except a textarea allows for multiple rows of data to be shown and entered
<li><b>select</b> — a drop-down list that displays a list of items a user can select from
</ol>

<ol>
<li><b>BUTTONS:</b><br><br>
Authors may create three types of buttons:

<ul>
<li>submit buttons: When activated, a submit button submits a form. A form may contain more than one submit button.
reset buttons: When activated, a reset button resets all controls to their initial values.
<li>push buttons: Push buttons have no default behavior. Each push button may have client-side scripts associated with the element's event attributes.
<br> When an event occurs (e.g., the user presses the button, releases it, etc.), the associated script is triggered.
</ul><br><br>

<li><b>CHECKBOXES:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Checkboxes (and radio buttons) are on/off switches that may be toggled by the user. A switch is "on" when the control element's selected attribute is set.<br>
<li>When a form is submitted, only "on" checkbox controls can become successful.<br><li> Several checkboxes in a form may share the same control name. Thus, for example, checkboxes allow users to select several values for the same property.<br>
<li>The INPUT element is used to create a checkbox control.<br>
</ul><br><br>

<li><b>RADIO BUTTONS:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Radio buttons are like checkboxes except that when several share the same control name, they are mutually exclusive: when one is switched "on".<br>
<li>all others with the same name are switched "off". The INPUT element is used to create a radio button control.<br>
</ul><br><br>

<li><b>MENUS:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Menus offer users options from which to choose. The SELECT element creates a menu, in combination with the OPTGROUP and OPTION elements.<br>
</ul><br><br>

<li><b>TEXT INPUT:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Authors may create two types of controls that allow users to input text.<br>
<li>The INPUT element creates a single-line input control and the TEXTAREA element creates a multi-line input control.<br>
<li>In both cases, the input text becomes the control's current value.<br>
</ul><br><br>

<li><b>FILE SELECT:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>This control type allows the user to select files so that their contents may be submitted with a form. The INPUT element is used to create a file select control.
hidden controls<br>
<li>Authors may create controls that are not rendered but whose values are submitted with a form.<br> 
<li>Authors generally use this control type to store information between client/server exchanges that would otherwise be lost due to the stateless nature of HTTP.<br>
<li>The INPUT element is used to create a hidden control.<br>
<li>object controls.<br>
<li>Authors may insert generic objects in forms such that associated values are submitted along with other controls. Authors create object controls with the OBJECT element.<br>
</ul><br><br>
